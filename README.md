In the first semester of my M.Sc. in Life Science Informatics, I undertook a project exploring various bioinformatical tools for gene quality analysis. 
This project encompassed a comprehensive investigation of tools like FastQC for initial quality control, Cutadapt for adapter trimming, STAR for RNA-Seq alignment, and Snakemake for workflow management. 
I not only gained proficiency in installing and utilizing these tools on a Unix platform, but also delved into the underlying methodologies and best practices for each step of the analysis pipeline. 
This project provided me with a hands-on understanding of the essential bioinformatic techniques employed to analyze next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for gene quality assessment.
